# jcjohnson/neural-style
Site: https://github.com/jcjohnson/neural-style

Install: med

Rendering Speed: slow

Results: med. I think I would need to run around 1000 passes

Overall: med. 

Other: This is the first one I tried and it was little underwhelming 

# andersbll/neural_artistic_style
Site: https://github.com/andersbll/neural_artistic_style

Install: ez but not well documented 

	install cuDNN first (must have nvidea)

	then install CUDArray

	then DeepPy, 
	
	copy Pretrained VGG 19 model into the neural_artistic_style dir.

Rendering Speed: slower then jcjohnson/neural-style seems to only use 1 cpu at a time

Results: needs more testing

Overall: very simple, very readable
